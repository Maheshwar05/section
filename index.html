I also love to go to art and history museums.

If you’re struggling to write it from your own point of view a trick is to use third person, just like you would with an artist bio: “John is a London-based illustrator…”</dd>

The name of the fabric originates from the French “de Nimes,” for the place where the weave originated, though it was first used extensively in Britain before it saw explosive popularity in the United States via jeans manufacturer Levi Strauss.</dd>
